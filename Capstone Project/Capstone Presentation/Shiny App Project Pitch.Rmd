## Executive Summary

- Natural Language Processing App
  + All code implemented using `R`
  + Hosted at https://www.shinyapps.io
$$\\$$
- Goal: Predict third word of tri-gram given two leading words
$$\\$$
- Use **Katz Back-Off Method** for predictions
  + Provide list of word predictions along with probabilities

## Training Corpus & Prediction Method
- Three (very large) starter files
  + `en_US.blogs.txt`
  + `en_US.news.txt`
  + `en_US.twitter.txt`

- Create a sample dataset using 5% each of the `.txt` files
  + Corpus created and cleaned using the `quanteda` package.

- Katz Back-Off Prediction Method
  + A generative n-gram language model that estimates the conditional probability of a word given its history in the n-gram of a training corpus.
