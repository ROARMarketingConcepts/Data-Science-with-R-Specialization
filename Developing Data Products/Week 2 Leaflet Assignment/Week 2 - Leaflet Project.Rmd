## Places Where I Have Lived

Use a picture of me as the icon for each location...
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
KenPic <- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = "KenPic.jpeg",
  iconWidth = 31*215/230, iconHeight = 31,
  iconAnchorX = 31*215/230/2, iconAnchorY = 16
)
```


```{r}
KenLatLong <- data.frame(
  lat = c(41.766667,41.716667,40.441944,42.295833,42.134064,42.083333,35.766667),
  lng = c(-71.45,-71.416667,-86.9125,-71.713333,-71.969017,-71.4,-78.633333))
KenLatLong %>% 
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(icon = KenPic, popup=c("Cranston, RI", "Warwick, RI - I was born here!", "West Lafayette, IN - Purdue University where I went to college!", "Shrewsbury, MA", "Charlton, MA", "Franklin, MA","Raleigh, NC - where I live now!"))
```
